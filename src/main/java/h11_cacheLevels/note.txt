 1. Requirements for Entity Class
    1. @Entity annotation
    2. @Id
    3. Getter-Setter
    4. Constructor
    5. fields cannot be final
    6. @Table
    7. @Column

 2. FetchType
    By default:
        OneToOne  --> Eager
        ManyToOne --> Eager
        OneToMany --> Lazy
        ManyToMany -->Lazy

 3. n+1 problem
    to avoid it:
       Fetch Type Eager (but suggested)
       SQL/HQL queries
       DTO Projection

 4. Hibernate Caching
    first level Cache(default)
    second level Cache(with some configuration)


 5. get vs load
    load():  if we do not need obj immediately, and if we are sure that object is in DB, then use load ()
            it act as lazy loading (will not hit DB)

    get() : if you are not sure about obj exist in DB, or if you use obj immediately then use get
